# AI Tutor Assistant

## Project Description:

AI Tutor is a personalized study assistant that integrates with a student’s Google Drive to provide AI-powered learning support. After signing up with Google authentication, students can create courses (classes), attach relevant documents, and interact with an AI model to understand, summarize, and quiz themselves on the material. Beyond basic Q&A, the platform will also provide practice exam generation, note corrections, and learning insights to help students better retain knowledge and prepare for exams.
